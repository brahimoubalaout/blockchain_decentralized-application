## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a **Decentralized Application (DApp)** that acts as a bridge between a mobile/web user interface and the Ethereum Blockchain.

The application allows users to interact with a **Smart Contract** deployed on a local blockchain (Ganache). It demonstrates the core principles of Web3 development:
* **Smart Contract Development:** Writing logic in Solidity to store and retrieve data ("Hello [Name]").
* **Compilation & Migration:** Using the **Truffle Framework** to deploy contracts.
* **Blockchain Interaction:** Using **Flutter** and **Web3dart** to send transactions and read state.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend Framework:** Flutter (Dart)
* **Smart Contracts:** Solidity (v0.5.x)
* **Development Framework:** Truffle Suite
* **Local Blockchain:** Ganache (Personal Ethereum Blockchain)
* **Dart Packages:**
    * `web3dart`: For RPC calls and transaction signing.
    * `provider`: For state management.
    * `http` & `web_socket_channel`: For network communication.

# Flutter Blockchain DApp

A simple decentralized application (DApp) built with Flutter that interacts with a smart contract on a local Ethereum blockchain (Ganache).

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
* **Node.js**
* **Truffle:** Install via terminal using `npm install -g truffle`
* **Ganache:** Download from [trufflesuite.com](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)
* **Flutter SDK**

---

### 2. Blockchain Setup
1.  **Launch Ganache.** It will start a local blockchain on `127.0.0.1:7545` (Network ID: 5777 or 1337).
2.  Open a terminal in the project root and compile the contracts:
    ```bash
    truffle compile
    ```
3.  Migrate (deploy) the contracts to Ganache:
    ```bash
    truffle migrate
    ```

---

### 3. Flutter Configuration (Important)
Before running the app, update `lib/contract_linking.dart` with your specific local settings:

**RPC URL:**
* **For Android Emulator:** Use `http://10.0.2.2:7545`
* **For Web (Chrome) / iOS:** Use `http://127.0.0.1:7545`

**Private Key:**
1.  Copy a private key from one of your **Ganache** accounts (click the "key" icon).
2.  Paste it into the `_privateKey` variable in `contract_linking.dart`.

---

### 4. Running the App
Install dependencies and run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
